Multiple Disease Prediction System

     1. Diabetes Prediction 

        Used data from Kaggle dataset and performed Data cleaning, Data Visualization for replacing of missing values and done Feature Scaling to transform the variables into a similar scale.
        Implemented Random Forest Classifier model along with Cross Validation techniques and achieved an accuracy score of 94.06%

     2. Heart Disease Prediction

         Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes model and performed Hyperparameter tuning using GridsearchCV
         Achieved AUC score of 0.90 and a best recall score of 0.88.

     3. Parkinsons Prediction

         Used data from Kaggle dataset and Feature selection is done for selecting top 10 important features.
         Handled imbalanced dataset using SMOTE and implemented Adaboost model with accuracy score of 92.3%!
